This subdirectory of Philip Zastrow's [How to Style HTML with CSS tutorial series](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/how-to-style-html-with-css) on DigitalOcean, represents his 19th tutorial installment, ["How To Style Figure and Image HTML Elements with CSS
"](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-style-figure-and-image-html-elements-with-css)

### _"Summary"_
