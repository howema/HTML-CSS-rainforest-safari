### _"How To Use Opacity and Transparency to Create a Modal in CSS"_

This subdirectory of Philip Zastrow's [How to Style HTML with CSS tutorial series](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/how-to-style-html-with-css) on DigitalOcean, represents his 18th tutorial installment, ["How To Use Opacity and Transparency to Create a Modal in CSS"](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-opacity-and-transparency-to-create-a-modal-in-css)

### _"Summary"_

In this tutorial, I worked with `opacity`, `pointer-events`, and `transition` to manipulate the appearance and behavior of modals. In addition, `transparent` was used on a button to display how it can be used in place of an animation to give a hover + gradient effect.
