### _"How To Style HTML Elements with Borders, Shadows, and Outlines in CSS"_

This subdirectory of Philip Zastrow's [How to Style HTML with CSS tutorial series](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/how-to-style-html-with-css) on DigitalOcean, represents his 17th tutorial installment, ["How To Style HTML Elements with Borders, Shadows, and Outlines in CSS"](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-style-html-elements-with-borders-shadows-and-outlines-in-css)

### _"Summary"_

In this tutorial, I went in-depth with the `border`, `shadow`, and `outlines` properties to learn how to add depth and definition to content. These properties can be used to soften content, make it stand out, and even make it more accessible.
