### _"How To Load and Use Custom Fonts with CSS"_

This subdirectory of Philip Zastrow's [How to Style HTML with CSS tutorial series](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/how-to-style-html-with-css) on DigitalOcean, represents his 15th tutorial installment, ["How To Load and Use Custom Fonts with CSS"](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-load-and-use-custom-fonts-with-css)

### _"Summary"_

This tutorial focuses on different ways to use fonts in the browsers. We started about implementing local fonts and a font stack to give the browser a backup plan. Next, we tried implementing the font-hosting service from Google Fonts. Finally, we wrapped things up by using `@font-face` for self-hosted fonts.
