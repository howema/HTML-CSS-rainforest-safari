### _"How To Apply Background Styles to HTML Elements with CSS"_

This subdirectory of Philip Zastrow's [How to Style HTML with CSS tutorial series](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/how-to-style-html-with-css) on DigitalOcean, represents his twelvth tutorial installment, ["How To Apply Background Styles to HTML Elements with CSS"](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-apply-background-styles-to-html-elements-with-css)

### _"Description"_

In this tutorial, we went over different ways that a background can be used or manipulated the the browser.


### _"Details"_

To start, `background-attachment` is pretty cool. I imagine this is what you'd use if you very specifically needed to design an animation of an elevator ascending.

I'm also very excited to start using `gradient`- especially with multiple backgrounds, like we did by adding `linear-gradient` on top of (before) the image url. 

The basic styling was done with `Grid`, but we haven't gone into a ton of detail on that yet.

"A gradient can also be used with opacity to make a photo more subdued, improving the legibility of any overlaying text." --> nice

* There's only `background-color` and `background-image`
* For `background-image`, you have the additional available properties of `background-repeat`, `background-position`, and `background-size`.
* `background-image`, again, can be made fixed
* `gradient`is a type of `background-image`, and there are three types. We focused on `linear`
