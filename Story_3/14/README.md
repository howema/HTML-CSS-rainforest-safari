### _"How To Use the Display Property to Manipulate the Box Model in CSS"_

This subdirectory of Philip Zastrow's [How to Style HTML with CSS tutorial series](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/how-to-style-html-with-css) on DigitalOcean, represents his 14th tutorial installment, ["How To Use the Display Property to Manipulate the Box Model in CSS"](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-the-display-property-to-manipulate-the-box-model-in-css)

### _Summary"_

This tutorial was all about the `display` property. This included `block` (defined areas, take up FULL WIDTH of PARENT), `inline` (for elements to exist within text flow ), and `in-line block`.

What's the difference? 
* block --> "breaks the current content flow"
* inline --> maintains it.     (current flow)

* inline-block --> has its own block, but maintains the properties of the parent


Interestingly, these concepts were practiced by changing the `<table>` elements to be block on a small screen, with a media query, and set them to return to their default display when in browser mode. 

In addition, we used `none` to hide content under certain conditions (aka when in mobile view), allowing the content to be cleaner and more accessible for all.
