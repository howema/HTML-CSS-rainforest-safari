### _"How To Select HTML Elements Using ID, Class, and Attribute Selectors in CSS"_

This subdirectory of Philip Zastrow's [How to Style HTML with CSS tutorial series](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/how-to-style-html-with-css) on DigitalOcean, represents his ninth tutorial installment, ["How To Select HTML Elements Using ID, Class, and Attribute Selectors in CSS"](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-select-html-elements-using-id-class-and-attribute-selectors-in-css)


### _"Summary"_

In this tutorial, I learned how to SELECT HTML like no other. Specifically, I learned and practiced with `id`, `class`, and attribute selectors. I combined and contrasted these three, and worked within their variations.


##### _Learning Out Loud_

I did not know that class selectors could be reused! You can define it once in CSS, then apply it multiple times in the HTML. Life is crazy.

I also learned that you can combine class selectors, giving the html multiple classes, while still keeping those classes separate in the CSS. You can also combine classes very specificially in the CSS by "chaining" them together. It's a fun mix-and-match situation.

As always, the more specific selector selector will take precedence.

Also use `id` / # to immediately scroll to the desired section on a page.

The attribute selector also has advanced settings that allow us to look for specific strings within the HTML attributes.


##### _Notes of Interest_

I'm starting to really see why the first time Zastrow introduced himself to us, he said to download multiple browsers. This isn't the first time in these tutorials where different browsers behave/require different styling. Here, we're talking about the varitability of the attribute (`<attr>`) selector.


Note- 
* type selectors ==> element selector, class selector, ID selector, attribute selector...
* I feel like the word _scoped_ is pretty cool. Like, down with 'specificity', and up with 'scope'
