### _"How To Style a Table with CSS"_

This subdirectory of Philip Zastrow's [How to Style HTML with CSS tutorial series](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/how-to-style-html-with-css) on DigitalOcean, represents his tenth tutorial installment, ["How To Style a Table with CSS"](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-style-a-table-with-css)

### Summary

In this tutorial, I learned how to build a table! And how to style it with CSS instead of going with

Note- 
* _Semantic_ --> to use with intended meaning (lol why didn't I put this together)
* I keep reading `<thead>` as "thread" and not "t-head," as in table head. Lord, help me.

##### _On Accessibility_

* It's important to use `<caption>`, and use it correctly, for both sighted and non-sighted individuals to easily and accurately gain context.
* Be sure to add styling, and in a deliberate manner, to further increase accessibility of contexual information.
