### _"How To Style Text Elements with Font, Size, and Color in CSS"_

This subdirectory of Philip Zastrow's [How to Style HTML with CSS tutorial series](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/how-to-style-html-with-css) on DigitalOcean, represents his third tutorial installment, ["How To Style Text Elements with Font, Size, and Color in CSS"](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-style-text-elements-with-font-size-and-color-in-css)

### _"Talk summary to me"_

In this tutorial, I learned how to manipulate font weight, size, and color. In addition, I learned how to load custom fonts from Google Fonts, and how the number assigned to each font relate to its weight. For our purposes, this will mostly relate to wether the font is `normal` or `bold`.

And let's not forget the fun review in using percentages in order to faciliate responsive web design. Ensuring that text relates to eachother makes it dynamic and easy to follow.

In my `styles.css`, my `h3` type selector is given a `font-weight` of `177.78%` after the use of our classic `(target / base) * 100` formula. In this case, our base is the body at `18px`. If we want our h3 to be equal to 32px, we have to apply the formula, dividing the target of 32 by the base of 18, and moving the decimal to the right two places.
