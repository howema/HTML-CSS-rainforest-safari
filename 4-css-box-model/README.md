This subdirectory of Philip Zastrow's [How to Style HTML with CSS tutorial series](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/how-to-style-html-with-css) on DigitalOcean, represents his fourth tutorial installment, ["How To Work with the Box Model in CSS"](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-work-with-the-box-model-in-css)

### _"The 10 Lessons My Crooked Nose Taught Me"_

Wow I learned so much from this tutorial! This was a very interessting section to me and I enjoyed going through it. To initially summarize, I learned about the border, padding, margin, height, and width properties. I realized that so much of CSS boils down to boxes, which is pretty facinating to me.

I especially enjoy the way the `padding` and `margin` properties work, and how they can involve either/both dynamic versus symmetric options! I will note that these two do not function quite the same, with `margin` being the more complicated and varying sibling to `padding`.

I also love the way these two box model properties play with implicity as the properties precede obviously best practice design principles. For example, in my `styles.css`, I have `padding: 20px 40px` within the type selector. The padding property uses the _implicit_ ...cant live without... idea of symmetry defining most good design to simply assign the first value of `20px` to the top (therefore also the bottom) and the second value of `40px` to the right (and therefore also the left).

Both of these pairs cannot exist without the other! So they _twin it up_ when padding chooses to feature only 2 `px` values. We love symmetry in nature, it is everywhere! Picture a butterfly, picture a face! In fact, the more symmetrical of a face a person has, the more they are percieved as `attractive`.

In socail psychology, there is a principle that basically boils down to "What is Beautiful is Also Good," meaning that if a person has a symmetrical, beautiful face, they must have other positive attributes as well. Ever notice that your one _really ridiculously good looking friend_ lives in a bubble of privilege? 

Take it from someone with the most adorably crooked nose; what is beautiful is also good--CSS demands goodness with it's implicitly good design standards.

P.S. - Note that the two features where `margin` differs from `padding` is that margin accepts negative values, and it can also use `auto` for centering content.
